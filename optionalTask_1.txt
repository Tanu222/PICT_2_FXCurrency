***************************
*
* Provide option to select currency-1 also as any currency rather than populating it as USD always.
* Use USD as through currency and derive exchange rate between 2 currencies. 
* For instance, if Sterling (GBP) and Australian Dollar (AUD) are the 2 currencies selected then derive direct exchange rate between GBP and USD. 
* Once exchange rate is derived between GBP and USD currency, use that as base to derive value for second currency which is AUD in this example.

Solution : 

The solution involves introducing a second input label for entering a base currency other than USD; The exchange rate of the base currency is divided by the exchange rate of the required currency( at the given date);
That is if :
7.490636704 BWP = 76.3243 DZD
(Both values equivalent to 1 USD)
Then 
1 BWP = 76.3243/7.490636704 DZD

The MySQL query:
SELECT <baseCur> AS er1,<reqCur> AS er2 FROM <tablename> WHERE date = <givenDate>;
For the given example:
SELECT BWP as er1,DZD as er2 FROM data WHERE date = 2012-01-03";

A function is created which excecutes the given query and stores the required exchange rate value in a variable:

var rate = (result[0].er2)/(result[0].er1)

This variable data is displayed on the screen


OR

We can use a reactjs dependency named : react-currency-conv

React component for currency conversion. Supports fetching latest and historical currency exchange rate based on the input date alongwith specific precision.

Installation
npm install react-currency-conv --save

Integration
You can get the converted value as the output of the react component and style it according to your preference.

from: Initial currency
to: Target currency
value: The amount that you want to get converted

-------

import React from 'react';
import CurrencyConverter from 'react-currency-conv';
 
export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <CurrencyConverter from={'USD'} to={'CAD'} value={29}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

------
Precision
Specify a specific precision:

--------

    // 2234.67 (default)
    <CurrencyConverter from={'USD'} to={'CAD'} value={29} precision={2}/>
    // 78.2482
    <CurrencyConverter from={'USD'} to={'CAD'} value={29} precision={4}/>

------
Date
To get the exchange rate value form :-

----
    // NOTE: The date should be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
    <CurrencyConverter from={'USD'} to={'CAD'} value={29} date={'2010-12-22'}/>

-----
All other attributes are applied normally to the element. For example, you can integrate bootstrap styling as:
----
    <CurrencyConverter from={'USD'} to={'CAD'} value={29} className="form-control"/>

----
