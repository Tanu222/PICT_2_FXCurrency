## Problem Statement

Create a dashboard which will allow users to analyze the exchange rates between two currencies
over a period of time. Users should have the option to select weekly, monthly, quarterly, and 
yearly charts. The dashboard should also display the date on which the rate was at its peak
(highest) and the date on which it was at its lowest. Users should be able to print the data 
in a chart. Input will be currency exchange rate dataset between a currency pair and will be 
provided in a file format. Use USD as Base Currency where first currency will always be USD and 
second currency will be variable. For instance, currency pairs could be USD/INR, USD/GBP, USD/EUR,
 USD/CAD etc.


# Currency Exchange Rate

An exchange rate is a rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another 
currency and affects trade and the movement of money between countries. 
A currency appreciates if it takes more of another currency to buy it and depreciates 
if it takes less of another currency to buy it.

User can review the trending exchange rate during the given duration in weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly intervals.
Highest and lowest exchange rate within the aforementioned data is displayed as additional information.
